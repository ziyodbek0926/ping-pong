***== Quest received. Develop an src/pong.c program for a two-player game, 
similar to Pong. To display the graphics, only use ASCII characters (with output

version using only the material of the course studied 
so far and the standard library.***

* ***Keys***:

***A/Z and K/M - to move the rackets;***
ZZ
***Space Bar - to skip an action at a certain step of the game in step-by-step mode.***

* ***Graphics***

***The field is a 80 x 25-symbol rectangle.*** 

***Racket size is 3 symbols;*** 

***Ball size is 1 symbol.***

* ***UI/UX***
